            <h2>About Honey Bees</h2>
            <p>Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are social insects known for their role in pollination and for producing honey and beeswax. They live in large colonies with one queen, many sterile females (workers), and, during the breeding season, some males (drones). Honey bees communicate with each other by dancing, which can convey information about the location and quality of food sources.</p>

            <h2>Their Importance</h2>
            <p>Honey bees play a crucial role in the environment by pollinating flowers, thereby helping plants to reproduce. They are responsible for pollinating about one-sixth of the world's flowering plant species and approximately 400 different agricultural types of plants. The agricultural value of honey bees in pollinating crops is estimated to be many billions of dollars annually.</p>

            <h2>Threats to Bees</h2>
            <p>Honey bees face numerous threats, including pests like the Varroa mite, which attaches to the body of the bee and weakens it by sucking fat bodies. The use of pesticides in farming can also be harmful to bees, as can the loss of habitat due to land development and climate change. These factors have contributed to what is known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), where a majority of worker bees in a colony disappear, leaving behind a queen and food.</p>

            <h2>How to Protect Them</h2>
            <p>To help protect honey bees, individuals can plant native flowers in their gardens, reduce pesticide use, and support local beekeepers by buying local honey. Advocating for conservation policies that protect pollinator habitats is also crucial. Additionally, those interested can take up beekeeping as a hobby to help maintain bee populations.</p>
